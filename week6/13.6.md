# Web Services

## Service Oriented Approach
* Most non-trivial web apps use services
* They use serviices from app others
* Services publish rules apps must follow to use the service (API)

## Multiple Systems
* Intially, two systems cooperate and split the problem
* Data/service become useful, multiple apps want to use info/app
