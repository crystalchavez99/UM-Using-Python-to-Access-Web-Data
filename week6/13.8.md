```Python
import urllib.request,urllib.parse,urllib.error
import twurl
import json
TWITTER_URL = "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends/list.json'
while True:
    acct = input('Enter Twitter Account' )
    if(len(acct) < 1): break
    url = twurl.augment(TWITTER_URL, {'screen_name': acct,'count': '5'})
```
