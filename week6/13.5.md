## Javascript Object Notation
* Object literal notation in JSON
* Created by Douglas Crockford
* Represents data as nested lists and dictionaries
```Python
import json
data = '''{
    "name" : "Chuck,
    "phone": {
        "type": "intl,
        "number" : "+1 734 303 4456"
    }
}'''
info = json.loads(data)
print('Name:',infor['name'])
```
