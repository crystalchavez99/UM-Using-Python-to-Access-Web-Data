# Networked Programs

## Application Protocol
* Since TCP and Python gives us reliable socket, what about it?
* Application Protocols:
  * Mail
  * World Wide Web

## HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
* Dominant Application Layer Protocol on the Internet
* Invented for the Web, to retrieve HTML, images, docs, ...etc
* Extended to be data in addition to docs

## HTTP
* It is a set of rules to allow browsers to retrieve web docs from servers over the internet

### What is Protocol?
* Set of rules all parties follow to predict each other's behavior
* Not bump into each other
  * `https://` Protocol
  * `www.dr-chuck.com` Host
  * `/page1.html` document

## Getting Data From Server
* Each time user clicks on a anchor tag with `href`it switches to a new page, which browser makes a connection to web server and issues a `GET request` to get content of the page at the URL
* Server returns HTML doc to browser and displays to user

## Internet Standards
* Standards for all internet protocols are developed by orgs
* Internet Engineering Task Force
* Standards are called Requests for Comments

## Make HTTP Request
` GET http://www.dr-duck.page1.htm HTTP/1.0`
* In Python:
```Python
import socket
mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org',80))
cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0 \n\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    if(len(data)< 1):
        break
    print(data.encode())
mysock.close()
```
* Code above prints HTTP Header, and HTTP Body
