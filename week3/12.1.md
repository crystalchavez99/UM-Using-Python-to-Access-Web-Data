# Networked Programs

## Transport Control Protocol
* Built on top of IP (Internet Protocol)
* Assumes IP might lose some data, stores and retransmit data if seems lost
* Hands flow control using transmit windows

## TCP Connections/Sockets
* An internet sock is an endpoint of a birectional interprocess communication flow accross IP network

## TCP Port Numbers
* A port is a applicaton specific software communications endpoint
* It allows multiple networked apps to coexist on the same server

### Common TCP Ports
* Telnet (23) - Login
* SSH (22) - Secure Login
* HTTP (80)
* HTTPS (443) - Secure
* SMTP (25) - Mail
* IMAP (143/220/993) - Mail Retrieval
* POP (109/110) - Mail Retrieval
* DNS (53) - Domain Name
* FTP (21) - File Transfer

## Sockets in Python
* Python has built in support for TCP Sockets
```Python
import socket
mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect( ('data.pr4e.org',80)) # host,port
```
