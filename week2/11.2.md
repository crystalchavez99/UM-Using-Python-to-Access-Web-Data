# Regular Expressions Part 2

## Match and Extract Data
* `re.search()` returns a True/Fale depend on whether the string matches the regex
* If we want the matching strings to be extracted, use `re.findall()`
```Python
[0-9]+ # one or more digits
re.findall('[0-9]+',string)
```
* When using `re.findall()` it returns a list of zero or more sub-strings that match regex

## Warning: Greedy Matching
* The repeat characters (`*` and `+`) push outward in both directions (greedy) to match the largest possible string

## Non-Greedy Matching
* Not all regex repeat codes are greedy. If you add a `?`, it will chill out the `+` and `*`

## Advanced Regex

### Fine Tune String Extraction
* Can refine the match for `re.findall()` and separately determine which portion of the match is to be extracted by using parentheses
```Python
y = re.findall('\S+@\S+',string)
# At least one non-whitespace
['stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za']
```
* Parentheses are not part of the match, they tell where to start and stop what string to extract

### Double Split Pattern
* Somtimes we split a line one way, and then grab one of the pieces of the line and split that again
```Python
words = line.split()
email = words[1]
pieces = email.split('@')
print(pieces)
```

### Regex Version
* Example: look through string until @ is found, match non-blank character and many of them. While extracting the non-blank characters
`@([^ ]*)`

### Escape Character
* If you want a special regex character to just behave normally, prefix it with `\`
