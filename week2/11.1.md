# Regular Expressions

* `Regular Expression` is also referred to as `regex` or `regexp` which provides a concise and felxible means to match string of text in a certain pattern.
* It is written in a formal language to be intepreted by the regex processor

## Understanding Regex
* Are powerful cryptic
* Language of marker characters

## Quick Guide
* ^ : Matches the beginning of a line
* $ : Matches the end of the line
* . : Matches any character
* \s : Matches whitespace
* \S : Matches any non-whitespace character
* `*` : Repeats a character zero or more times
* `*?` : Repeats a character one or more times (not greedy)
* `+` : Repeats a character one or more times
* `+?` : Repeats a character one or more times (not greedy)
* [aeiou] : Matches a single character in the listed set
* [^XYZ] : Marches a single character not in the listed set
* [a-z0-9] : Set of characters can include a range
* ( : Indicates where string extraction is to start
* ) : Indicates where string extraction is to end

## Regex Module
* Before using regex in program, must import library `import re`
* Can use `re.search()` to see if string matches regex, similar to using `find()` for strings
* Can use `re.findAll()` to extract portions of string that match regex, similar to combo of `find()` and slice
```Python
import re
hand = open('mbox.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('From:',line):
        print(line)
```
```Python
import re
hand = open('mbox.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.startswith('From:',line):
        print(line)
```

## Wild-Card Char
* The dot character matches any character
* If you add asterisk character, character is `any number of lines`
* Example; X-Sieve: CMU Sieve 2. 3 ===> `^X.*:`
  * `^X` Matches X start of the line
  * `.` Match Any Character
  * `*` Many times
  * `:` Plain Text

## Fine-Tuning Match
* Depending on clean data, narrow match down a bit
