# Networked Programs

## ASCII
* American Standard Code for Info Interchange

## Representing Simple Strings
* Each character is represented by a number between 0 and 256 stored in 8 bits of memory
* We refer to 8 bits of memory as a byte of memory
* `ord()` function tells us the numeric value of a ASCII character
```Python
print(ord('H')) # 72
print(ord('e')) # 101
```

## Multi-Byte Characters
* To represent the wide range of characters computers must handle, we represent characters with more than one byte
  * UTF-16 - Var Len - 2 OR 4 Bytes
  * UTF-32 - Fixed Len - 4 Bytes
  * UTF-8 - 1-4 Bytes
    * Upward compatibile with ASCII
    * Auto detect between ASCII UTF-8

## Two Kinds of Strings in Python
* Python 2 has type '`unicode`'
* Python 3 has class '`str`'
  * All strings are unicode

### Python 3 and Unicode
* All strings internally are Unicode
* Usually works when it comes to string variables and reading data from files
* We talk to a network resource using sockets or to a database we have to encode and decode

## Python Strings to bytes
* When we talk to extrernal resource like network socket we send bytes, need to encode Python 3 strings into given char encoding
* When we read data //. we must decode it based on char set to properly represent as string

## HTTP Request in Python
```Python
import socket
mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org',80))
cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0 \n\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    if(len(data)< 1):
        break
    print(data.encode())
mysock.close()
```
